# Ousterhout Design Principles

Apply principles from "A Philosophy of Software Design" by John Ousterhout to create software architectures that minimize complexity and maximize developer productivity.

## Core Philosophy

**Complexity is the root of all software problems.** The primary goal of software design is managing complexity—making systems easier to understand, modify, and maintain. Complexity accumulates from many small decisions; reducing it requires constant vigilance.

## The Five Core Principles

### 1. Deep Modules Over Shallow Modules

A module's depth is the ratio of functionality to interface complexity.

**Deep modules** provide powerful functionality behind simple interfaces:
- Hide implementation complexity from callers
- Offer significant capability with minimal cognitive load
- Examples: Unix file I/O (5 calls do everything), TCP/IP socket interface

**Shallow modules** expose complexity without hiding it:
- Interface nearly as complex as implementation
- Force callers to understand internal details
- Red flag: methods that just pass through to other methods

**Design for depth:**
- Maximize what the module does
- Minimize what callers need to know
- Ask: "Can I make this interface simpler while keeping the functionality?"

### 2. Information Hiding

Each module should encapsulate design decisions that are likely to change:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Lower-level implementation details
- Platform-specific behavior
- External service interactions

**Information leakage** (a red flag) occurs when:
- Multiple modules share knowledge of the same design decision
- Changes ripple across module boundaries
- Implementation details appear in interfaces

**Apply information hiding:**
- Identify decisions likely to change
- Encapsulate each decision in one module
- Expose behavior through interfaces, not implementation

### 3. Different Layer, Different Abstraction

Each layer in a software system should provide a distinctly different abstraction:

**Good layering:**
- Each layer transforms the problem representation
- Lower layers handle details, upper layers handle concepts
- Clear separation of concerns between layers

**Pass-through methods** indicate bad layering:
- Method does little except call another method with similar signature
- Indicates missing or wrong abstraction level
- Adjacent layers may need consolidation

**Design distinct layers:**
- Define what abstraction each layer provides
- Ensure each layer adds genuine value
- Eliminate pass-through patterns

### 4. Pull Complexity Downward

When complexity is unavoidable, push it into implementation rather than interfaces:

**Pulling down complexity:**
- Handle edge cases internally rather than requiring callers to handle them
- Provide sensible defaults instead of requiring configuration
- Make common cases simple, even if uncommon cases become more complex internally

**The principle in practice:**
- Module developers should suffer for their users
- A little extra complexity in one place saves complexity in many places
- Ask: "Can I handle this case internally rather than exposing it?"

### 5. Define Errors Out of Existence

Reduce complexity by designing interfaces that cannot produce errors:

**Techniques:**
- Change semantics so "errors" become valid operations
- Handle edge cases internally with defined behavior
- Use default values instead of requiring explicit values

**Examples:**
- Substring beyond string end: return empty string (not error)
- Delete non-existent item: succeed silently (idempotent)
- Read from empty queue: block or return null (not exception)

**Design error-free interfaces:**
- Question every exception: is it truly necessary?
- Define behavior for all inputs
- Make operations idempotent where possible

## Design Process: Design It Twice

Before committing to an architecture, consider at least two fundamentally different approaches:

1. **Generate alternatives**: Create genuinely different designs, not variations
2. **Compare trade-offs**: Evaluate each against requirements
3. **Learn from comparison**: Even rejected designs teach what matters
4. **Combine insights**: Best design may combine elements

This principle applies at all scales: system architecture, module design, API design.

## Red Flags for Complexity

Watch for these warning signs when reviewing architecture:

| Red Flag | Symptom | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Shallow modules** | Interface as complex as implementation | Consolidate or redesign for depth |
| **Information leakage** | Same knowledge in multiple places | Centralize in one module |
| **Pass-through methods** | Method just calls similar method | Eliminate layer or add value |
| **Pass-through variables** | Variable passed through many layers | Consolidate or use context object |
| **Conjoined methods** | Can't understand A without understanding B | Make each independently understandable |
| **Excessive configuration** | Many knobs for every behavior | Provide sensible defaults |
| **Special-case code** | Many if statements for edge cases | Define edge cases out of existence |

## Module Depth Analysis

Evaluate each module's depth score:

**Deep (Target):**
- Simple, stable interface
- Significant hidden complexity
- Callers need minimal knowledge
- Changes rarely affect interface

**Medium (Acceptable):**
- Moderate interface complexity
- Some hidden complexity
- Callers need some understanding
- Occasional interface changes

**Shallow (Refactor):**
- Interface matches implementation complexity
- Little hidden complexity
- Callers need detailed knowledge
- Frequent interface changes

## Applying Principles to Architecture

When designing architecture from requirements:

1. **Identify core abstractions**: What are the fundamental concepts?
2. **Define module boundaries**: Where should information be hidden?
3. **Design interfaces first**: What's the simplest interface for each module?
4. **Evaluate depth**: Is each module providing significant hidden functionality?
5. **Check for red flags**: Review against the complexity indicators
6. **Design it twice**: Consider alternative module decompositions
