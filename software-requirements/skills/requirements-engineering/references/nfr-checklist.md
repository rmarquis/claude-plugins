## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Initial review**: Go through categories relevant to the feature
2. **Prioritize**: Mark which NFRs are critical vs nice-to-have
3. **Quantify**: Add specific, measurable targets where possible
4. **Validate**: Confirm requirements with stakeholders
5. **Document**: Include relevant NFRs in the requirements document

Not every item applies to every feature. Focus on categories relevant to the specific functionality being specified.
