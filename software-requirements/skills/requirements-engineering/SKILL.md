Produces structured markdown requirements documents with functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

# Requirements Engineering

Transform informal feature descriptions into structured, actionable software requirements documents through systematic analysis and targeted clarification.

## Core Process

### 1. Analyze the Initial Description

When receiving an informal description, identify:

- **Core functionality**: What the system must do
- **Implied requirements**: Unstated but necessary capabilities
- **Ambiguities**: Vague terms needing clarification
- **Missing information**: Gaps that need user input

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

Focus on 3-5 targeted questions addressing the most significant gaps:

**Priority question areas:**

1. **Users and roles**: Who uses this? Different permission levels?
2. **Scale and performance**: Expected load, response times, data volume?
3. **Integration points**: What existing systems must it work with?
4. **Error handling**: What happens when things go wrong?
5. **Security concerns**: Authentication, authorization, data sensitivity?
6. **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, unusual scenarios?

**Question formulation guidelines:**

- Ask specific, concrete questions (not "tell me more")
- Offer options when possible to reduce cognitive load
- Group related questions logically
- Prioritize questions that unblock multiple requirements

### 3. Structure the Requirements Document

Generate a markdown document with these sections:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Requirements

## Overview
Brief description of the feature, its purpose, and primary goals.

## Functional Requirements
### FR-1: [Requirement Name]
**Description**: What the system must do
**Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify it works
**Priority**: Must Have | Should Have | Nice to Have

### FR-2: [Next Requirement]
...

## Non-Functional Requirements
### NFR-1: Performance
- Response time targets
- Throughput expectations
- Scalability requirements

### NFR-2: Security
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization rules
- Data protection needs

### NFR-3: Reliability
- Uptime expectations
- Recovery requirements
- Data integrity constraints

## Constraints
- Technical limitations
- Business rules
- Regulatory requirements
- Timeline constraints

## Assumptions
- Dependencies on other systems
- User capabilities assumed
- Environment assumptions

## Open Questions
- Items requiring further stakeholder input
- Technical decisions pending investigation
- Scope items needing clarification
```

### 4. Save the Document

Save requirements to: `docs/requirements/<feature-name>.md`

- Create the `docs/requirements/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Use kebab-case for the filename
- Derive the name from the feature being specified

## Requirement Writing Guidelines

### Functional Requirements

Write each requirement to be:

- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous language
- **Measurable**: Includes acceptance criteria
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible
- **Relevant**: Directly supports a user need
- **Traceable**: Can be linked to user goals

**Good example:**
```
### FR-3: Password Reset
**Description**: Users can reset their password via email verification link
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Reset link sent within 30 seconds of request
- Link expires after 24 hours
- User receives confirmation after successful reset
**Priority**: Must Have
```

**Bad example:**
```
### FR-3: Password stuff
Users should be able to reset passwords easily.
```

### Non-Functional Requirements

Quantify where possible:

- "Response time under 200ms for 95th percentile" (not "fast")
- "Support 1000 concurrent users" (not "scalable")
- "99.9% uptime" (not "highly available")

### Priority Levels

- **Must Have**: Core functionality, system won't work without it
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical for initial release
- **Nice to Have**: Enhances experience, can be deferred

## Interactive Refinement Pattern

When refining requirements interactively:

1. **Acknowledge** the description received
2. **Summarize** understanding of the core request
3. **Identify** the key gaps or ambiguities
4. **Ask** 3-5 focused clarifying questions
5. **Draft** requirements based on answers
6. **Review** with user for accuracy
7. **Finalize** and save the document

Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured question presentation when multiple options exist.

## Common Patterns

### CRUD Operations

For data management features, ensure requirements cover:
- Create: Validation rules, required fields
- Read: Filtering, sorting, pagination
- Update: Partial vs full updates, versioning
- Delete: Soft vs hard delete, cascading effects

### User Authentication

Standard requirements to consider:
- Login methods (email/password, OAuth, SSO)
- Session management (duration, concurrent sessions)
- Password policies (complexity, expiration)
- Account recovery mechanisms
- Audit logging

### API Endpoints

For each endpoint, specify:
- HTTP method and path
- Request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting
- Error responses
