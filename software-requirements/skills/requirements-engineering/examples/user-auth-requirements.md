# User Authentication Requirements

## Overview

Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their account credentials. The system should support both email/password authentication and OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) while maintaining security best practices.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Registration
**Description**: New users can create an account using email and password
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Email must be unique and valid format
- Password must meet complexity requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- User receives verification email within 60 seconds
- Account is inactive until email is verified
- Registration form shows real-time validation feedback
**Priority**: Must Have

### FR-2: Email Verification
**Description**: Users must verify their email address before account activation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Verification link is valid for 24 hours
- Clicking valid link activates account and redirects to login
- Expired links show clear message with option to resend
- Users can request new verification email (max 3 per hour)
**Priority**: Must Have

### FR-3: User Login
**Description**: Registered users can authenticate with email and password
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Successful login creates session and redirects to dashboard
- Failed login shows generic "Invalid credentials" message
- Account locks after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
- "Remember me" option extends session to 30 days
**Priority**: Must Have

### FR-4: OAuth Authentication
**Description**: Users can register/login using Google or GitHub accounts
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- OAuth buttons visible on login and registration pages
- First OAuth login creates new account linked to provider
- Subsequent OAuth logins authenticate existing account
- Users can link/unlink OAuth providers in settings
- Email from OAuth provider is pre-verified
**Priority**: Should Have

### FR-5: Password Reset
**Description**: Users can reset forgotten passwords via email
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Reset request sends email within 60 seconds
- Reset link valid for 1 hour, single use
- New password must meet complexity requirements
- All existing sessions invalidated after reset
- User receives confirmation email after successful reset
**Priority**: Must Have

### FR-6: Session Management
**Description**: Users can view and manage active sessions
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Settings page shows all active sessions (device, location, last active)
- Users can terminate individual sessions
- "Log out all devices" option terminates all sessions except current
- Session automatically expires after 24 hours of inactivity
**Priority**: Should Have

### FR-7: Password Change
**Description**: Authenticated users can change their password
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Requires current password for verification
- New password must differ from current
- New password must meet complexity requirements
- All other sessions invalidated after change
**Priority**: Must Have

### FR-8: Account Deletion
**Description**: Users can delete their account and associated data
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Requires password confirmation
- Shows summary of data to be deleted
- 30-day grace period before permanent deletion
- User can cancel deletion during grace period
- Confirmation email sent upon deletion request
**Priority**: Should Have

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Login API response time < 500ms (p95)
- Registration API response time < 1s (p95)
- Support 100 concurrent authentication requests
- OAuth callback processing < 2s

### NFR-2: Security
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- All authentication endpoints over HTTPS only
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting: 10 login attempts per minute per IP
- Session tokens: 256-bit random, HTTP-only, secure cookies
- Audit log all authentication events

### NFR-3: Reliability
- Authentication service 99.9% uptime
- Graceful degradation if OAuth providers unavailable
- Email delivery within 60 seconds (99th percentile)

### NFR-4: Compliance
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Password requirements meet NIST SP 800-63B guidelines
- Audit logs retained for 90 days

## Constraints

- Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database
- Email service limited to SendGrid
- OAuth implementation must use official SDKs
- No SMS-based authentication (cost constraint)
- Must support existing user table schema

## Assumptions

- Users have access to email for verification
- Modern browsers only (no IE11 support)
- Single-tenant application (no organization/team features)
- English-only interface for initial release

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement "Login with Apple" for iOS users?
2. What is the acceptable session timeout for mobile apps vs web?
3. Do we need to support SAML/SSO for enterprise customers?
4. Should password reset also offer security questions as backup?
